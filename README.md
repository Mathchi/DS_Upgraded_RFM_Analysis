# Business Problem with Customer Segmentation (RFM ANALYSIS)

An e-commerce company wants to segment its customers and determine marketing strategies according to these segments.

For this purpose, we will define the behavior of customers and we will form groups according to clustering.

In other words, we will take those who exhibit common behaviors into the same groups and we will try to develop sales and marketing techniques specific to these groups.

I have already shared the code for RFM Analysis in both Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/mathchi/business-problem-with-customer-segmentation) and github(https://github.com/Mathchi/Customer-Segmentation-with-RFM-Analysis) accounts. Now I tried to make this more dynamic. I hope it will be useful for everyone.
